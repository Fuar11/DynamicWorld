# Dynamic World

Dynamic World is a gameplay mod for **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Studios

It aims to make the world of Great Bear Island mmore dynamic by adding events that change the world over time or add some immersion and flavor.

## Earthquakes and Tremors

Great Bear Island has been ravaged by seismic activity throughout it's history, and that's not stopping as the quiet apocalypse sets in. Earthquakes and their associated seismic tremors ravage Great Bear at customizable intervals, with custom audio to go with them.

### Tremors

Over time, you will experience bouts of seismic activity ranging in severity. The least severe cases are minor tremors, which usually last a few seconds.
These can occur at random as well as preceeding and proceeding major earthquakes. 

### Earthquakes

While tremors can occur at random, they usually preceed and proceed major earthquake events. These seismic events are far more powerful than minor tremors and usually last for longer (up to 20-30 seconds) 
and appear more violent and louder. These quakes don't occur nearly as frequently, but can permanently alter the landscape around you.

#### Transition Zones

After a major earthquake, certain transition zones may become blocked off. Tunnels and caves may collapse and bridges may fall, forcing survivors to find other ways around the world. 
With the proper setting enabled (disabled by default), certain one way transition zones or entire sets of transition zones may become blocked, cutting off entire regions from the rest of Great Bear. Trapping players inside, or out of that area.

## Settings

The time interval between earthquake events can be modified in the Mod Settings menu, along with the option for transition zones to become "hard locked" and block off entire regions or sets of regions. 
For example, the mine to Desolation Point can block off that region. Or the ravine and winding river cave can block off Mystery Lake from Pleasant Valley and Coastal Highway. 
This option is disabled by default.
